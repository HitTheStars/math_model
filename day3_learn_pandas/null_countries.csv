,"Delicate white flowers and a spin of lemon peel on the nose start this refined white. The bright fruit on the palate is tropical and exotic, but the minerality gives it lift. Fuller-bodied but poised, the wine has aging potential and a food-friendly character.",Askitikos,90,17.0,,,,Assyrtiko,Tsililis
,"A blend of 60% Syrah, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot, this inky garnet-colored wine offers aromas of cassis and elderberry. On the palate, there is a combination of cooked fruit and cool spice flavors yet there is no lack of accompanying acidity. Flavors of cassis, elderberry, anise, orange peel and vanilla are backed by silky tannins that stay smooth into the cooling finish.",Shah,90,30.0,,,,Red Blend,Büyülübağ
,"From first sniff to last, the nose never makes much of an impression; the wine has funk and generic chemical aromas but also your basic red apple and char. Pretty big and aggressive in the mouth, with snaggy acids and rough tannins.",Piedra Feliz,81,15.0,,,,Pinot Noir,Chilcas
